Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Credential::OpenID

0.03  Fri Oct 26 13:22:10 PDT 2007
        - Removed t/9*.t from MANIFEST since they're never supposed to be shipped
          (Thanks to rjbs)
        - Accepts URI as an authenticate_openid()'s 2nd parameter so
          you can use parameter name other than "claimed_uri".

0.02  Wed May  2 17:05:02 PDT 2007
